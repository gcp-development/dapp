# Contract UI

This [React App project with TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/), was developed using [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and using [Firefox React Developer Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

Install the node 20.2.0 version.
```bash
nvm install 20.2.0
```
Note:nvm install node, "node" is an alias for the latest version.

List installed versions.
```bash
nvm ls
```

To create a similar project.
```bash
nvm use 20.2.0
npx react-native init contract_ui
```
Note: When we create a new React Native app(0.71 version) via the React Native CLI we will get a [TypeScript app by default](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2023/01/12/version-071).

To run the project.
```bash
cd contract_ui
npx react-native start
npx react-native run-android
```
